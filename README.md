# Team Profile Generator
  
## As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic information so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles. In this project, I need to create a Team Progile Generator that satisfies the following criteria: 
  1. When prompted for my team members and their information, an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
  2. When you click on an email address in the generated HTML file, your default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.
  3. When you click on the GitHub username, the GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
  4. When you start the application, you are prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
  5. When you enter the manager's information, you are presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.
  6. When you select the Engineer option, you are prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, then you are taken back to the menu.
  7. When you select the Intern option, you are prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, then you are taken back to the menu.
  8. When you choose to finish building your team, you exit the application and the HTML is generated.
